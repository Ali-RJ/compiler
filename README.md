# compiler
This is a simple compiler that I implemented in python. The file names and their code are self-explanatory, so I am not going to explain it.

This compiler compiles from K language to C. In the test folder you can find out the domain of the K language (simple self-made language) and the corresponding exported C file. For more elegant understaning looking at the code could be beneficial.
